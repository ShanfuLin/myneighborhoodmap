## Quickstart

Importing of code from GITHUB

From your terminal, run the following code (in the director which you want the folder to be cloned into) to clone the code needed to run the application:

  git clone https://github.com/ShanfuLin/myneighborhoodmap.git

This will give you a directory named 'myneighborhoodmap' completed with all the code necessary to run the single-page application featuring a map of my "meighborhood". To run the code, there are 2 methods.

The first simply required you to open your browser and then open the file "index.html". The user will then see a map of Singapore with a list of possible locations that one can visit.

The second method involves deploying the directory 'myneighborhoodmap' to local host using Python. Before proceeding with this second method, ensure that you have Python 2 installed on your computer. On OS X, Python is pre-installed and this command works out of the box. One options of doing so will be to install Python via Homebrew.

1) To install Homebrew, open terminal and run:

  $ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

2) After Homebrew is installed, proceed to install Python (2) using the following commands:

  $ brew install python    

3) When installation is completed, using terminal commands, go to the directory where 'myneighborhoodmap' code are downloaded into. Proceed thereafter to run the following commands in the said directory to host the website on localhost, port 8000:

  $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

4) Go to your browser, enter "localhost:8000" in your browser address. Voila, the webpage will be right there for you!
